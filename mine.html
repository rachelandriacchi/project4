				<p>Twice a year, we have a thing called SLCs at Da Vinci.<br>
				SLCs stand for Student Led Conferences. On those days, we have a shortened schedule.<br>
				The shortened schedule is:<br>
				<br>
				<b>Office Hours~ 7:50-8:45<br>
				Period 1~ 8:50-10:10<br>
				Period 2~ 10:15-11:30<br>
				Lunch~ 11:30-12:00<br>
				Period 3~ 12:05-1:20</b><br>
				<br>
				Normal class periods are about 1 hour and 35 or 45 Minutes long.<br>
				During SLC weeks, class periods are 1 hour and 20 minutes long, meaning we only lost 15-25 minutes of class each day.<br>
				From experience, I saw that we were able to get the same amount of work done on shorter days as we did on regular days.<br>
				I had a worksheet to do for math one of the days and was still able to get the entire thing done in one period.<br>
				The only part of the schedule that would need to change is to make some time for seminars and advisory.<br>
				If an hour and 30 minutes were added, we could have about one hour for seminar and around 30 minutes for advisory.<br></p>
